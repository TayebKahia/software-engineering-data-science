    "Typical python projects use multiple packages for various tasks and some of the packages are shared between projects. However, sharing same packages between projects can cause problems. A virtual environment is a way to have multiple, parallel instances of the Python interpreter, each with different package sets and different configurations, avoiding the problems caused by sharing.\n",

    "#### More About Lists Indexing and Slicing\n",
    "List are like strings, they can be indexed and sliced. For example lets create a list called `my_list` as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [_ for _ in 'abcdefghi']\n",
    "my_list\n",
    "['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Indexing\n",
    "To retrieve an element of the list, we use the index operator (`[]`). Note that:\n",
    "* Lists are “zero indexed”.\n",
    "* It is possible to use negative indexing (from the end of the list), where `[-1]` returns the last element. \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Slicing\n",
    "A slice is a subset of list elements. In the case of lists, a single slice will always be of contiguous elements. Slice notation takes the form\n",
    "`\n",
    "my_list[start:stop]\n",
    "`\n",
    "where `start` is the index of the first element to include, and `stop` is the index of the item to stop at without including it in the slice. So `my_list[1:5]` returns `['b', 'c', 'd', 'e']`\n",

    "A dictionary is a Python ***object*** that is a flexible data container for other objects. It contains these objects using what are called ***key*** - ***value*** pairs. You create a dictionary like this:\n",

    "                  'website': \"https://learnche.org\",\n",
    "                  'nested_tuple': (1, 2.0, [3, 4], '5', (6, 7.0))\n",

    "print(random_objects)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that it is unlikely when you print the ``random_objects`` variable, that you see the dictionary written back in the order shown above. Dictionaries are an ***unordered*** container. \n",

    "random_objects['short_list']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, the keys were all ***string*** objects. But that is not required. You can use integers, floating point values, strings, tuples, or a mixture of them. There are other options too, but these are comprehensive enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary values may be any ***objects***, even other dictionaries. Yes, so a dictionary within a dictionary is possible. We will use this below. That is why we partially why we waited to introduce dictionaries until now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary objects are excellent ***containers***. If you need to return several objects from a function, collect them in a dictionary, and return them in that single object. It is not required, but it can make your code neater, and more logical.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Try it\n",
    "\n",

    "2. `slope`: a floating-point slope value\n",
    "3. `R2`: the $R^2$ value of the regression model\n",
    "4. `std_err`: a value which is the model's standard error\n",
